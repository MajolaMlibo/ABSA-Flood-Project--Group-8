### Executive Summary
This report presents an analytical study conducted for CZR Insurance Group. 
The main aim for this research was to predict the frequency and severity of flood events in the Western Cape on a monthly basis.
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and predictive modelling techniques were applied aided by the use of 
provided historical climate and dam-level data to identify key drivers of flood risk and establish actionable
business recommendations to mitigate financial exposure.

### Introduction
## Background
CZR Insurance Group was founded in response to the increasing severity and frequency of flood events in Southern Africa.
The organization seeks to develop data-driven approaches to better understand flood risk
and protect communities from financial losses caused by climate-related disasters.

## Objectives of the study
- Analyse historical climate and dam-level data for the Western Cape
- Identify trends that lead to flood
- Develop predictive models for flood frequency and severity
- Propose business strategies to reduce financial risk

### Data Description 
## Provided Data
- Monthly climate variables for the Western Cape (2017-2021)
- Dam-related variables for dams in the Western Cape (2017-2021)

## Variables Overview
Key variables include:
- Temperature (max, min, avg)
- Atmosperic Conditions (air pressure, wind speed, humidity)
-  Dam metrics (water in dam, storage capacity, dam level)

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
This section focuses on:
- handling missing values
- dam data aggregation (where applicable)
- time index construction (year and month)

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Temperature vs Precipitation
![Average Temperature vs Precipitation](EDA\Images\scatterPlot.png)

The scatter plot between temperature and precipitation shows points scattered across the plot with no clear pattern. 
This indicates that there is no linear relationship between temperature and precipitation. 
Therefore, higher temperatures do not necessarily lead to increased rainfall, 
meaning temperature alone is not a reliable predictor of flood events

## Monthly Temperature Trends
![](output\BoxPlot.png)

The boxplots illustrate seasonal temperature trends across months. 
The blue boxes represent the interquartile range (IQR). 
Temperatures are highest between months 1–3 and 11–12, corresponding to summer, and lowest between months 6–8, corresponding to winter. 
This confirms clear seasonal temperature patterns in the Western Cape.

## Correlation Analysis

The correlation matrix shows that the temperature variables exhibit very strong positive correlations with one another, indicating potential multicollinearity. 
Average temperature displays a strong negative correlation with air pressure. Additionally, humidity and precipitation show a positive relationship, 
suggesting that higher humidity may lead to increased rainfall, which is relevant for flood risk analysis.

### Predictive Modeling
## Model Selection
Three models were developed to predict monthly precipitation:
- Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
- Random Forest
- ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)

## Model Performance

| Model | RMS | 
|:---|:---:|
Linear Regression | 14.887095162742119
Random Forest | 16.712679729684645
GLM Gamma | 14.832046592584199

An evaluation was conducted on all three models using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test data. 
The GLM achieved the lowest RMSE of 14.83, 
indicating it had the smallest average error in predicting rainfall

The graph visualizes the perfomance of our models compared to the actual data. As observed, 
the GML closely tracks the seasonal peaks of the actual data, confirming its reliability for forecasting.

## Forecasting Results

![](output\Forecast_2026.png)

This graph represents the ARIMA(Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model. 
It tells us when we can expect the next flood. 
From the graph we observed that June-August has the highest chances of experienceing floods(Winter) in each year. 
The shaded area represents the confidence interval (we are 80%-95% sure the real rainfall will fall inside this area)

### Key Insights

- Precipitation and humidity are the strongest predictors of flood risk
- Dam capacity plays a significant role in flood severity
- Temperature influences flood risk indirectly through seasonal patterns

### Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis and predictive modeling, the following recommendations are proposed to CZR Insurance Group:
- Implement dynamic pricing strategies that adjust premiums based on predicted flood risk.
- Enhance customer education programs on flood preparedness, especially during high-risk months.
- Invest in advanced monitoring systems for real-time flood risk assessment.
- Collaborate with local governments to improve flood mitigation infrastructure.
